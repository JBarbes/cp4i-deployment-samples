# Cognitive Car Insurance Claims Demo
This demo shows how to use the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration to create, expose and manage an API which allows insurance customers to submit a car repair claim and have it automatically processed and a repair estimate returned in real-time.

It uses IBM Watson AI image recognition to analyse a photo of the car, IBM Watson AI to translate the claim into Spanish when using a 3rd party repair company and also shows integration with Salesforce and ServiceNow using the App Connect Smart Connectors.

The artefacts for this demo are currently stored in a different repository [Here](https://github.com/IBM/cp4i-demos/tree/main/cognitive-car-insurance-claims) - it is intended to move them to this repository in the future.

The instructions to build and run this demo are in this repository in the Docs directory [Here](Docs/README.md) - click to get started!
