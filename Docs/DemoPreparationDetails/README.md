# Demo Preparation details
PLACEHOLDER - TODO

This will give details of how to set up the demo preparation if you have a CP4I environment already existing.

It will also give details of what instances, capabilities and artefacts that the demo preparation sets up, if you wish to create similar for yourself or use them for your own demos.
