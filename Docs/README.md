# CP4I Deployment Samples - Documentation

This repository contains a number of 'Demos' or Deployment Samples which can be run on the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I)

Each Demo has separate instructions, held in the Docs folder under the Demo's own folder.

There are also 'common' instructions which cover tasks applicable to multiple demos, for example setting up an environment or configuring a connector which is re-used.

To get started, choose your demo below:

* [Driveway Dent Deletion][../DrivewayDentDeletion/Docs/README.md]

* [Event Enabled Insurance][../EventEnabledInsurance/Docs/README.md]
