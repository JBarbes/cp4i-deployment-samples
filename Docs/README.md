# CP4I Deployment Samples - Documentation

This repository contains a number of 'Demos' or Deployment Samples which can be run on the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I)

Each Demo has separate instructions, held in the Docs folder under the Demo's own folder.

There are also 'common' instructions which cover tasks applicable to multiple demos, for example setting up an environment or configuring a connector which is re-used.

# List of Demos

To get started, choose your demo below:

[**Driveway Dent Deletion**](../DrivewayDentDeletion/Docs/README.md)

[**Event Enabled Insurance**](../EventEnabledInsurance/Docs/README.md)

# Common Documentation
The following Documentation is common across multiple Demos

[**Setting up Connectors**](../Connectors/README.md)
This covers both setting up the connectors in CP4I and creating free developer/lite accounts in the services used for the demos.
